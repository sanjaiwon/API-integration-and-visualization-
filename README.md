PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

Project Title:API integration and Visualization using Python

This project, developed by Sanjai Krishnan S, an intern at Codetech IT Solutions from Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology, showcases the power of Python in visualizing real-world weather data using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.

The focus of Task 1 is API Integration and Data Visualization. Although live API access was unavailable in the current test environment, the project effectively simulates real-world data using offline static samples representing five major Indian cities: Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata. Each city has associated weather data such as temperature (in °C), humidity (%), and weather conditions (e.g., Clear, Clouds, Rain).

Three major types of visualizations were created:

1. Bar Chart – Illustrates the temperature comparison across cities, helping users visually grasp which city is the hottest or coolest.


2. Line Chart – Displays humidity levels in each city, with annotated data points and grid lines for clarity.


3. Pie Chart – Represents the distribution of weather conditions across all cities, giving an overview of the most common weather type.

This project helps build key skills in data analysis, styling visual plots, and presenting insights clearly. The code uses user-friendly formatting, icons, and descriptive messages to make the output engaging and easy to understand.

Overall, the project meets its objective of demonstrating Python’s capability in integrating and visualizing data, laying the foundation for more advanced tasks involving real-time API data in future stages.
